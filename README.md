# Quarto + GitHub Contributing Clinic

A website that is a 1.5-hr session to teach folks how to contribute to Quarto sites & books on GitHub. Analogous to our [GitHub Clinic](https://openscapes.github.io/series/core-lessons/github/) with 2x short lessons and activities.

[POP](https://suzannehawkes.com/2010/04/09/pop-everything/):

**Purpose**: teach NASA Openscapes Mentors a workflow with Quarto and branch/pull requests. For contributing to Cookbook but also anything. Invite other Openscapes Mentors as a way to re-connect and skillbuild. 

**Outcomes**: Mentors build skills, more empowered/equipped for contributing. Also we have a new clinic we can iterate on and reuse. 

**Process**: The website is the Clinic; no additional slides.

-   1: Targeted intro to Quarto
-   2: GitHub Workflow: How to make a branch, (draft) pull request, communicate what you’re doing
